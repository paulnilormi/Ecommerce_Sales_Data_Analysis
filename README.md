# Ecommerce_Sales_Data_Analysis
📊 E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis – Dual Perspective Project
Welcome to a comprehensive data analysis project that explores real-world E-Commerce sales data from two powerful perspectives:

👉 Seller-centric view – to analyze business performance

👉 Customer-centric view – to understand buyer behavior

Using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, this project dives into a CSV file containing 200+ online transaction records, uncovering hidden trends, sales patterns, revenue drivers, and customer insights.

🗂️ Project Structure

This repository contains two mini-projects built on the same dataset:

📦 1. Seller View: Business Performance Analysis:

Focuses on how products and sales perform from a business owner's perspective.

🏙️ Top 5 cities contributing most to revenue

📦 Most profitable products by total sales

📈 Monthly sales trends to visualize seasonal performance

📅 Sales over time for time-series revenue monitoring

🔍 Goal: Help businesses identify what sells, when, and where—enabling better inventory, pricing, and marketing decisions.

👤 2. Customer View: Behavioral & Revenue Analysis:

Shifts the lens to customers—how they behave, spend, and interact.

💸 Top 10 high-spending customers using RFM segmentation

💳 Most used payment methods

📆 Customer-wise monthly spending trends

🌎 State-wise revenue breakdown

📦 Top 10 most profitable products

🔥 Sales heatmap by day and hour to identify peak shopping times

🔍 Goal: Empower businesses to optimize customer relationships, target segments, and improve user experience.

🛠️ Technologies Used:

🐍 Python – for scripting and logic

📊 Pandas – for data manipulation and transformation

🧮 NumPy – for numerical operations

📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn – for generating professional, clean, and insightful data visualizations
